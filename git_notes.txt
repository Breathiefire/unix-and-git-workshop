Things I have learned about Git

Git is software.
Git allows multiple people to work with multiple files at once.
Git keeps a complete history of all changes.
Git has steps to get to commit
	make change
	add untracked file
	stage the change
	commit the change (you should as a comment of what you changed git commit -m “”)
branching adds “drawers” that have a copy of the master. This new branch can be changed without changing the master.

You can work on one branch at a time by switching branches.

[Note from instructor: Kay asked perceptive questions and really seemed to grasp the material in a meaningful way.]
