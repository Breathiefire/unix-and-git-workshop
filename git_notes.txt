Things I have learned about Git

Git is software.
Git allows multiple people to work with multiple files at once.
Git keeps a complete history of all changes.
Git has steps to get to commit
	make change
	add untracked file
	stage the change 
	commit the change (you should as a comment of what you changed git commit -m “”)
